# News App (Flutter)

News headlines app built with Flutter, Provider, and a simple clean architecture. The app fetches US top headlines from NewsAPI, supports category filtering via a bottom sheet, search with offline cached fallback, pull-to-refresh, and a detail view for each article.

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `lib/core/constants.dart` with a valid NewsAPI key.
